				<h2>Built for you</h2>
				<p>Music isn't just about individual songs. You are a talented individual with stories to share, and nepTune focuses on you as an artist&mdash;a creator of awesome music.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Feature">
				<h2>Tell your story</h2>
				<p>You have your influences and favorite bands, and your songs are inspired by a great story&hellip;or maybe you just started with a really cool chord. Either way, we would love to know about where you and your inspiration came from! nepTune provides a great way for you to share this through exclusive content that fans unlock when they support your music.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Feature">
				<h2>Beautiful homepage</h2>
				<p>Your music deserves better than a page that looks like a newspaper article. nepTune gives you a beautiful home for you and your fans and makes it incredibly easy for fans to find what they're searching for.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Feature">
				<h2>Fair promotion</h2>
				<p>Labels shouldn't have the right to decide what music fans listen to. nepTune gives every artist an opportunity to get their music out in front of people and discover success. Along the way, you'll build a loyal fanbase who love you and your music. Doesn't that sound better than having a guy in a tacky suit decide what people listen to?</p>

				<h2>Sharing at the speed of sound</h2>
				<p>nepTune makes it incredibly easy for listeners and artists alike to share songs they like with each other.

			</div>
			<div class="Feature">
				<h2>Crowd-sourced talent</h2>
				<p>Maybe you're an incredibly talented guitarist, but you don't know how to make a music video. Or maybe your band is ready to release a great album, but you don't have any cover art. But you have a great fanbase, and <em>someone</em> will know how to make that music video, or create that cover art. nepTune is committed to bringing artists and fans together, and great things come out of that interaction.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Feature">
				<h2>Surrounded by quality</h2>
				<p>Your music shouldn't be next to random family videos&mdash;it deserves an environment surrounded by other great music and an audience who will appreciate it. nepTune provides this incredible environment, and we would love for you to be a part of it.</p>

				<h2>Discover incredible new music</h2>
				<p>nepTune fosters an artistic environment where artists are free to explore creative ideas and create great music. This means that you get pure creativity, not an autotuned, mass-produced mess.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Feature">
				<h2>Sounds from around the world</h2>
				<p>nepTune uses the freedom of the internet to spread music around the world. Whether you like African pop or the traditional sounds of Southeast Asia, nepTune brings all of those sounds together in one place for your listening pleasure.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Feature">
				<h2>Simple, clean, controllable sharing</h2>
				<p>nepTune is designed with sharing in mind. When you hear a song you like, you can share it with any number of people. This increases the amount of new music you discover and helps support the artists as well.</p>

				<h2>Support your favorite artists</h2>
				<p>Independent artists create great music, and they have the right to make a living from their work. nepTune allows you to support amazing artists by sharing the songs you like and buying the songs you love. The proceeds from the songs you buy go directly to the artist&mdash;no record label to get between artists and what they've earned.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Feature">
				<h2>Zero risk</h2>
				<p>Buying music through most sites is a risk. You have to shell out money to get the whole song, and then what happens if you decide you don't like that song? There's nothing you can do about it. nepTune lets you listen to the whole song and then decide whether you want to buy it. When you decide that you like it, a quick donation to the artist is all it takes before <em>boom!</em> the song is yours, on all your devices, forever.</p>
