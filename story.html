		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>Humans should not be machines. We live, breathe and come up with incredible new ideas and works of art. But too often our environment stifles our ability to do great things. Extensive red tape and greedy people trying to capitalize on every single thing someone else does are arresting progress in our world.</p>
		<p>nepTune's mission is to liberate human creativity. We're creating a world where people are no longer content to push papers all day, a world of people who want to push boundaries. We're turning traditional business models inside-out and, with nepTune Music, we're creating an incredible community that supports musicians as they create amazing work.</p>
		<p>Music is an art that touches everyone. For centuries, music  evolved through many different styles, and all had their supporters. Talent came from around the world. But as the 20<sup>th</sup> century rolled along, a disease began to spread. Music became an "industry", dominated by "executives" and "celebrities". Artistry and nuance was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZazEM8cgt0">stamped out by corporations who thought they knew what people wanted to listen to</a>. We're creating nepTune Music to bring the art back into music. It's an incredible first step into the future of creativity&mdash;into the future of the world.</p>
		<p>We envision a world where people are able to explore and create and make a career out of it. We envision a world where people can hear great music from around the globe, where artist deserve to make a living from their work. We envision a world where everyone can just be awesome.</p>
